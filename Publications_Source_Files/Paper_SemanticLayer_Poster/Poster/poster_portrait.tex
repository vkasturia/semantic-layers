%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
   Despite the increasing number of web archives worldwide, the absence of 
   efficient and meaningful exploration methods still remains a major hurdle 
   in the way of turning web archives into a usable and useful source of 
   information. 
   
   For a bit more complex information needs,
   like \emph{exploratory search needs}, keyword-based 
   search in web archives leads to ineffective interactions and poor results.  
   Thus, there is the need to go beyond keyword-based
   search and support more advanced information seeking strategies.

   We make the following contributions:
   \begin{enumerate}\compresslist
   \item   We introduce a simple but flexible RDF/S data model,
        called {\em Open Web Archive},
   \item   We detail the process of constructing semantic layers and
        we present an open source and distributed framework,
        called {\em ArchiveSpark2Triples}, that facilitates their efficient construction.
   \item   We present (and make publicly available)
        three semantic layers for three different types of web archives:
        one for a {\em  versioned web archive},
        one for a {\em non-versioned news archive},
        and one for a {\em social-media archive}.
   \item   We present the results of a comparative evaluation using a set
        of 20 information needs of exploratory nature.

         end-users to easily and efficiently explore web archives.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
  We have introduced a model and a framework
  for describing and publishing metadata and
  semantic information about web archives.
  The constructed {\em semantic layers} allow:
  \begin{enumerate}\compresslist
  \item exploring web archives in a more advanced way
  based on entities, events and concepts extracted
  from the archived documents and linked with web resources.
  \item integrating information coming from multiple knowledge bases 
  and semantic layers.
  \item inferring new knowledge that is very laborious to derive 
  otherwise.
  \item coping with common problems when exploring web archives like
  temporal reference variants and multilinguality.
  \item making the contents of web archives machine understandable,
  thereby enabling their direct exploitation by other systems and
  tools.
  \end{enumerate}
  The results showed that semantic layers
  can answer complex information needs that keyword-based search systems
  fail to satisfy.
